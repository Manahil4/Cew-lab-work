### 1. **`lockfile`:**
- **Purpose:** Create semaphore files to implement simple file locking.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  $ lockfile testfile.lock
  ```

### 2. **`cksum`:**
- **Purpose:** Calculate a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) checksum and the byte count.
- **Example:**
  ```
  $ cksum myfile.txt
  ```

### 3. **`comm`:**
- **Purpose:** Compare two sorted files line by line.
- **Example:**
  ```
  $ comm file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

### 4. **`csplit`:**
- **Purpose:** Split a file into sections based on context lines.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  $ csplit myfile.txt /pattern/ {*}
  ```

### 5. **`chattr`:**
- **Purpose:** Change file attributes on a Linux file system.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  $ chattr +i myfile.txt
  ```

### 6. **`touch`:**
- **Purpose:** Change file timestamps or create empty files.
- **Examples:**
  - Update timestamp:
    ```bash
    $ touch myfile.txt
    ```
  - Create an empty file:
    ```bash
    $ touch newfile.txt
    ```
- For `lockfile`, it's commonly used in shell scripts to ensure only one instance of the script runs at a time.
- `cksum` is useful for checking file integrity.
- `comm` is often used to find commonalities or differences between two sorted files.
- `csplit` is handy for splitting log files or extracting sections from large files.
- `chattr` can be used for setting immutable flags on files to prevent accidental deletion.
- `touch` is versatile; it can update timestamps or create empty files.

### 1. `cpio` Command:
The `cpio` command is used for copying files to and from archives. It can handle a variety of input and output formats, making it a versatile tool for archiving and copying files.

Example: Creating a CPIO archive from a list of files:
```bash
$ find . -type f | cpio -o > archive.cpio
```

This command finds all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and creates a CPIO archive named `archive.cpio`.

### 2. `sort` Command:
The `sort` command is used for sorting lines of text files. It is a powerful tool for arranging data in ascending or descending order.

Example: Sorting lines in a text file:
```bash
$ sort myfile.txt
```

This command sorts the lines in `myfile.txt` alphabetically. You can use options like `-n` for numeric sorting or `-r` for reverse order.

### 3. `fuser` Command:
The `fuser` command is used to identify processes using files or sockets. It provides information about which processes are accessing a specified file or directory.

Example: Checking processes using a file:
```bash
$ fuser myfile.txt
```

This command displays the process IDs (PIDs) of the processes using `myfile.txt`.

### 4. `file` Command:
The `file` command is used to determine the type of a file by examining its contents. It can identify various file formats and provides information about the file.

Example: Checking the type of a file:
```bash
$ file myfile.txt
```

This command provides information about the type of `myfile.txt`, such as whether it's a text file, binary file, or something else.

### 5. `tar` Command with the `z` Option:
The `z` option of the `tar` command is used to compress the archive using gzip. It's often used in conjunction with creating or extracting tar archives.

Example: Creating a compressed tar archive:
```bash
$ tar czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/source
```

This command creates a tar archive of the specified source directory and compresses it using gzip.

### 6. Difference between `cp` and `cpio`:
- `cp` copies files and directories, providing a straightforward method for copying data.
- `cpio` is more flexible and is often used in conjunction with find to create archives. It's particularly useful for handling special file types, like device files or symbolic links.

### 7. Permissions `777` vs. `775` in `chmod`:
- `777` grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.
- `775` grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, read and execute permissions to the group, and read and execute permissions to others.
